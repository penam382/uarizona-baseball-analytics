This project provides an in-depth analysis of baseball performance data, focusing on both hitter and pitcher tendencies. By leveraging tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau, the project evaluates player performance through advanced metrics, visualizations, and statistical summaries. Key insights include:

Pitcher Analysis: Examines pitch effectiveness, usage patterns, and outcomes. Highlights include Jack Berg’s versatility, with dominant Slider and ChangeUp pitches yielding high swing-and-miss rates, and the Sinker excelling as a ground ball pitch.
Hitter Analysis: Investigates hitting tendencies, pitch interactions, and situational performance. Garen Caulfield’s .366 batting average and .756 slugging percentage showcase elite hitting capabilities, with notable success against left-handed pitchers and in neutral and disadvantageous counts.
Visualizations: Scatter plots, strike zone charts, and spray charts provide actionable insights into pitch locations, movement, and hitter tendencies.
